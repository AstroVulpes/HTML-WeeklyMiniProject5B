# Weekly Mini Project 5B
## Lexicon IT-p√•byggnadsutbildning
This program builds a website with 4 links: home, products, contact, and about. These can be accessed in the header. The footer contains links to Instagram, Facebook, and email (non-functional). The Products page lists 8 cupcakes and 8 wedding cakes with photos, names, and price in a dynamic grid. The contact page has a (purely visual) contact form, and the home page has a (visual-only) newsletter subscription field..
